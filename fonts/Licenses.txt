This documents contains the license information of fonts modified and distributed with SDFonts

1. Font Data Modification Process
The font data used in SDFonts are modified by the following process


[1] Horizontal Font Layout
(1) Convert OpenType / TrueType fonts to Bitmap MicroPython font (*.py) using a python script "font_to_py.py"
This script is modified by the author of SDFont module to handle unicode chars properly.
Original script is at https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-font-to-py/
Converted characters are ASCII (0x20-0x7F), Hankaku Kana in JIS X 0201, and Kanjis in JIS X 0208
Available sizes are 16, 20, 24, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52 (pixels of maximum height), but bigger size might not be usable due to lack of memory.

(2) Precompile python font using mpy-cross and create *.mpy font


[2] Vertical Font Layout (font files that begins with "@")
(1) Extract Font data for Vertical Layout using subset font maker (サブセットフォントメーカー) by Musashi System. (https://opentype.jp/)
The tool can be downloadble from https://opentype.jp/subsetfontmk.htm

(2) Same as [1](1) 

(3) Same as [1](2)


2. Font License information for the modified fonts made for SDFont module.
The license of each font follows that of its original font unless otherwise clearly noted.
I want to thank all designers, developers, and engineers related to the fonts below.
