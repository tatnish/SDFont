# About This Document
This documents contains the license information of fonts modified and distributed with SDFonts

# 1. Font Data Modification Process

The font data used in SDFont module are modified (converted) by the following process.

Note: The author of SDFont module didn't modify any font gryphs or shapes. All fonts are simply
converted to bitmap font by freetype python module, and then stored in bytes data structure of micropython.


## Horizontal Font Layout
 1. Convert OpenType / TrueType fonts to Bitmap data in MicroPython script (*.py) using a python script ["font_to_py.py."](https://github.com/tatnish/micropython-font-to-py)
This script is modified by the author of SDFont module to handle unicode chars properly.
The original script is available [here](https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-font-to-py/).
Converted characters are ASCII (0x20-0x7F), Hankaku Kana in JIS X 0201, and Kanjis in JIS X 0208

 2. Compile python font files using mpy-cross tool to create *.mpy files for performance improvement


## Vertical Font Layout (font files that begins with "@")
 1. Extract Font data for vertical layout using "Subset Font Maker"([サブセットフォントメーカー](https://opentype.jp/))
     - The tool can be downloadble from [here](https://opentype.jp/subsetfontmk.htm)

 2. Rest are the same as steps for Horizontal Font Layout
